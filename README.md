# Battery State of Charge (SOC) Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the State of Charge (SOC) of batteries based on provided battery parameters. The CNN model is trained on a dataset (`actual_data_bms.csv`) and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
